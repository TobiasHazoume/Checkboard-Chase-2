what is a struct?
it's like a class but the default field is public by default
, unlike a class where fields are private by default.
example:

```
typedef struct SDL_Rect
{
    int x, y;
    int w, h;
} SDL_Rect;

```

what are emuns?
 Enumerations are a fast and simple way to make constants variables instead of having to do 

 ```
 const int KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_DEFAULT = 0; 
 const int KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_UP = 1; 
 const int KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_DOWN = 2; 
 ```
 and such.

 heres how to make  emums
 ```
enum KeyPressSurfaces
{
    KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_DEFAULT,
    KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_UP,
    KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_DOWN,
    KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_LEFT,
    KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_RIGHT,
    KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_TOTAL
};
 ```
what values to these have?
enums default to start counting at 0 and go up by one for each enumeration you declare 
so KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_TOTAL = 5. (sidenote enums could make switch staement conveient)

what is the -> operator?
its used to  access members of a structure or a class through a pointer

how do I  do this?
```
void LTexture::render( int x, int y, SDL_Rect* clip )
{
	//Set rendering space and render to screen
	SDL_Rect renderQuad = { x, y, mWidth, mHeight };
	
	//Set clip rendering dimensions
	if( clip != NULL )
	{
		//this means renderquad.w is = to the value of x inside the obj clip  
		//this is done using ht pointer clip
		renderQuad.w = clip->w;
		
		renderQuad.h = clip->h;
	}
```
I'snt that like the . operator?
 yes but it does NOT access members with a pointer
